>###OBJECT
>   To move all four of a player's marbles around the board from Base position to "home safe". You don't HAVE to be AGGRAVATING, but it helps.
>###INSTRUCTIONS for PLAY as INDIVIDUALS
>   Each player rolls his die once to determine who plays first. Player rolling highest number is first and chooses his color, placing the four marbles in "Base" position as shown in diagram. Play will proceed to the left, each player choosing his color and placing his four marbles in "Base" position.
>   With all marbles now in "Base" position, first player rolls his die. Either a one or a siz must be rolled to take a marble from "Base" to "Start" location, (marked by a single hole of the player's color). Players roll their die in turn, moving marbles which have been started the exact number of places or starting a new marble. ALSO, the rolling of a six entitles that player to an additional turn IF he was able to use the six just rolled.
>   As play proceeds, a player may not jump or land on a marble of his own color. However, when a player's move lands his marble on a space occupied by *another* player's marble, he may AGGRAVATE, BY REPLACING THAT MARBLE WITH HIS OWN. The AGGRAVATED player must re-start the marble from his "base" position. Marbles are ALWAYS subject to AGGRAVATION until in "home safe". First Player with all four marbles "safe home" is winner of the game.
>###USING THE OPTIONAL "SHORT-CUTS"
>   There are six "Short-Cut" corner positions on the playing board as indicated in the diagram (.) and one center-board "Short-Cut". When the number rolled lands a player's marble exactly on any one of six corner "Short-Cut" positions, he may, beginning with his next turn, choose to move that marble around, using the corner holes only and thus shorten the path to his "Safe-Home" goal. In using this short-cut method, a player may move any number of spaces as rolled, counting around the corner holes until reaching the row leading to his "Safe-Home" position. He then continues down that row to his "Home" area as in regular play.
>   The center-board position is a "Super Short-Cut" that may be used from any location on the board when a player roles the exact number that would place him in the center hole if he chooses to use it. In order to leave the center-board "Short-Cut" position however, a player must roll a "one", at which time he may proceed to any of the six corner positions (.) on the board. This method offers a fine defensive maneuver when one of the opponents is nearly finished as well as being a great "Short-Cut" to a player's "Home". But WATCH OUT! "Short-Cuts" are popular and you can be AGGRAVATED from there too!
>~~###PARTNERSHIP PLAY~~
>~~###TEAM PLAY~~

##Modifications
* When jumping between the corner shortcuts, you can only roll to land on another shortcut. This means if you want to go to your home row, you MUST land exactly on the corner one turn, then on your next turn go down your row.
* I am not doing partnership/team play.

##Actual Gameplay/Rules Summary
###Choosing players
Increment the player count to enable more places to enter player names. For each player, enter a name and choose a color (red, blue, green, white, orange, or yellow). Only one player per color. At least 2 and no more than 6 players can be created.

###Going first
The color to go first is randomly chosen from the current player list. The remaining player order is also chosen randomly.

###Basic turn process
1. Roll Die by clicking on die image.
2. Select marble of your color to move by clicking on it. If the marble is highlighted, it is movable with your current roll. If you cannot move any marbles, a message will appear and your turn will be over.
3. Select position to move marble out of the highlighed possible choices. You can also choose to select a different marble to move by clicking on it.
4. A window will appear asking for move confirmation. If you choose yes, your marble will be moved to the selected position and the next player's turn will start. If you choose no, you will be set back to step 

###Winning the game
The moment a player has all four marbles in their home base, they have won. A message will be displayed and the game will exit.
